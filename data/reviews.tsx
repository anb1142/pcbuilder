			"In this day and age it's a rare thing to find someone enthusiastic, energetic and professional about what they do. My experience with CUSTOM PC BUILDER was amazing. His mission was to build me a PC for my daughter, a surprise gift, that would make me the Best Dad Ever. We surprised her with the machine and she cried. Mission accomplished. He worked within my budget, asked pertinent questions, made great choices. I would recommend his services to anyone who needs a PC. Thanks again.",

He was always courteous and nice. He answered all my questions. And he gave really good advice. As a result, the finished product of my PC is amazing. Attached is a video of it.\nHe is extremely knowledgeable, and I highly recommend his services.",

			"Amazing! First time purchasing a PC and I was told to build my own, which I was not going to tackle on my own. I reached out to the Custom PC Builder and I was surprised with how quickly the response was and the knowledge this man holds. He is professional, friendly and reasonably priced. I would recommend him to anyone looking into purchasing a PC.\nPs. Still have wrapping on glass because I'm nervous I will grease up the screen",

Pretty much helped me 24/7 over the course of a month or so, there is nothing he could have done better. Literally, do not go to anybody else, this is precisely who you want.",
